# ML-House-Price-Prediction

House Price predictor is a  machine learning model which predicts house prices for various regions in USA.

This project is helpful for real estate agents who wants some help predicting housing prices for various regions in USA. My machine learning model allows real-estate agenets to put in a few features of a house and returns back an estimate of what the house would sell for.

# About the dataset

### Size of the dataset: 5000 rows x 7 colums

The data contains the following columns:

'Avg. Area Income': Avg. Income of residents of the city house is located in.
'Avg. Area House Age': Avg Age of Houses in same city
'Avg. Area Number of Rooms': Avg Number of Rooms for Houses in same city
'Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms': Avg Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city
'Area Population': Population of city house is located in
'Price': Price that the house sold at
'Address': Address for the house


# Approaches to the probelm:

### 1.Evaluating the dataset
### 2. Splitting the dataset
### 3. Applying Machine Learning algorithms to train our model
### 4. Intepreting from the trained model
### 5. Testing our model
### 6. Evaluating our model


# Algorithm and Evaluation details:

In this project, I have implemented linear regression for training my model and Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE) as the evaluation metric. 

Overall, from the dataset I could infer that, 1 unit increase in Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms is associated with an increase of $2233.80 of the house price.
